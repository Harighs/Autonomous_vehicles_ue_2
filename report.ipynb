    "- Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) with ResNet: The model uses FPN built on a ResNet backbone to process the LiDAR data. This combination particularly helps in detecting objects across various scales and sizes by utilizing a hierarchical feature pyramid.\n",

    "- Model uses a bird's-eye view (BEV) map to represent the LiDAR point cloud data. The BEV map is a 2D representation of the 3D point cloud data from a top-down perspective.    \n",
    "- The BEV map is created by discretizing the 3D space into a grid and projecting the LiDAR points onto the grid. Each cell in the grid contains information about the points that fall within it, such as the height, intensity, and other features.\n",
    "- Roughly the BEV computation can be broken down into the following steps:\n",
    "  - Filtering Points: filter out points outside the specified x, y, and z limits. \n",
    "  - Normalization: normalize the z-coordinates by subtracting the minimum z limit, which helps in handling different elevation levels correctly.\n",
    "  - Discretization: convert x and y coordinates to BEV map indices. The adjustment for y-coordinates to ensure there are no negative indices.\n",
    "  - Channel Computation: Then calculate channels for height, density, and intensity.\n",
    "  - Returned BEV Map is of 608x608x3 shape.\n",

    "Kalman filtering is algorithm that us mostly used in requirments of control theory to estimate the states predictions and update based on \n",
    "measurements of datapoints based on some amount of period of time. This is also known as Linear quadratic Estimation. In this time is one of dependent parameters\n",
    "for this algorithm, also this records statistical noices and inaccuracies and estimates the values of unknown variables.this is a recursive algorithm, \n",
    "meaning that it operates in a cycle, where it takes in an input, processes it and provides an output, and then repeats the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm works by a two-phase process having a prediction phase and an update phase. For the prediction phase, the Kalman filter produces estimates of \n",
    "the current state variables, along with their uncertainties. Once the outcome of the next measurement (necessarily corrupted with some error, including random noise) \n",
    "is observed, these estimates are updated using a weighted average, with more weight being given to estimates with greater certainty. The algorithm is recursive. \n",
    "It can operate in real time, using only the present input measurements and the state calculated previously and its uncertainty.\n",
    "\n",
    "Parameters of kalman filter:\n",
    "- State vector: It is a vector that contains all the information about the state of the system. It is the vector that we want to estimate.\n",

    "- Control matrix: It is a matrix that describes how the control input affects the state of the system.\n",
    "- Measurement matrix: It is a matrix that describes how the state of the system is related to the measurements.\n",
    "- Process noise covariance: It is a matrix that describes the noise in the state transition process.\n",
    "- Measurement noise covariance: It is a matrix that describes the noise in the measurements.\n",
